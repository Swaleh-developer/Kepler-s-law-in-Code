Calculating the period of a satellite, the time required for a satellite to make a complete trip around the earch as determined by Kepler's law.
We define the period as a function of the distance of the satellite from the center of the earth.
Period = C x distance exp 1.5
C is a constant approx equal to 1/100. The period is in seconds and the distance in Kilometers

Determine the approximate distance in kilometers above the earth - user input
Set a radius of the earth which is a constant = 6378 km
